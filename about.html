            <h1>About Gavin Reid</h1>
            <p>I'm Gavin Reid. With a background in machine learning and a knack for innovative problem-solving, I specialize in Natural Language Processing with a passion for creating cutting-edge AI solutions.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>My academic background, including recent coursework in Applied Linguistics, Data Science, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and software development, has provided me with the skills necessary to excel in this role. 
            <p></p>
            <p>I am currently pursuing an advanced course in Data Scientist: Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning (Codecademy). This has given me a solid foundation in text preprocessing methods including noise reduction, tokenisation, normalisation (stopword removal, upper/lowercasing, stemming, lemmatisation) and part-of-speech tagging, along with the opportunity to build a wide range of predictive models and to explore Neural Language Models.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>This closely aligns with my MA in Applied Linguistics (University of Leicester, 2019, Distinction), for which my dissertation focused on metacognition and the ability of second language listeners to identify, classify and explain their own problems with the decoding of the speech signal.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>I recently completed CS50P: Programming with Python (Harvard University, 2024) which has provided me with a thorough understanding of Python along with developing effective problem solving skills. I have also completed certifications in Data Analytics with Google, and Responsive Web Design, giving me a strong foundation in data literacy, Exploratory Data Analysis, statistics, data cleaning, tidying and wrangling and creating meaningful data visualisations. I have had hands-on experience with Jupyter Notebook, GitHub, SQL, R, C, Java and a range of Python libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, NLTK, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow.</p>
